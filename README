inputs : angular positions (vector 7d) and charge (vector 6d : Fx, Fy, Fz, Cx, Cy and Cz)

2 models are available :
-model12 with classic stiffness model at each joint
-model42 with anisotropic stiffness at each joint

stiffness parameters depends on the model chosen

outputs : correction of position and orientation (vector 7d : 3 double for position and 4 double for orientation) to bring to the effector (depending on the model chosen)
